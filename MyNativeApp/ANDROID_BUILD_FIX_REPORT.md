# Android Build Failures - Diagnostic Report & Solution

## Problem Summary

The Android build is failing with dependency compatibility issues between React Native 0.80.2 and newer versions of `react-native-svg` and `react-native-screens`.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issues Identified:

1. **react-native-svg compatibility errors:**
   - `StandardCharsets` class not found in `com.facebook.react.common`
   - `setPointerEvents` access privilege issues (attempting to assign weaker access privileges)
   - UTF_8 variable not found
   - Static import errors

2. **react-native-screens compatibility errors:**
   - `ChoreographerCompat` unresolved references
   - Kotlin compilation errors with frame callback
   - Type mismatch errors in Choreographer.FrameCallback

### Versions Tested:
- **react-native-svg**: 14.1.0 → 13.4.0 → 12.5.1 → 12.1.1 (all failed)
- **react-native-screens**: 3.29.0 → 3.20.0 → 3.18.2 → 3.15.0 (all failed)

## Systematic Debugging Process

1. ✅ **Analyzed dependency compatibility issues**
2. ✅ **Updated package.json with multiple compatible version attempts**
3. ✅ **Performed clean reinstalls** (removed node_modules, package-lock.json)
4. ✅ **Cleaned Android build cache** (gradle clean, removed build directories)
5. ✅ **Tested builds with progressively older versions**

## Key Findings

The issue persists across multiple version downgrades, indicating that **React Native 0.80.2 has fundamental compatibility issues** with these libraries. The errors suggest that:

1. **React Native 0.80.2 API changes**: The `StandardCharsets` class and other React Native internal APIs have changed between versions
2. **Library expectations**: These libraries expect newer React Native APIs that don't exist in 0.80.2
3. **Build system incompatibility**: The Android build system configuration may need updates

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Upgrade React Native (Recommended)
```json
{
  "react-native": "^0.72.0",
  "react-native-svg": "^13.4.0",
  "react-native-screens": "^3.20.0"
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Resolves all compatibility issues
- Access to latest features and security updates
- Better long-term maintainability

**Considerations:**
- May require code changes for breaking changes
- Need to test all app functionality after upgrade

### Option 2: Use Compatible Legacy Versions
```json
{
  "react-native-svg": "^12.0.0",
  "react-native-screens": "^3.10.0"
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Maintains current React Native version
- Minimal code changes required

**Considerations:**
- May miss newer features
- Potential security vulnerabilities in older versions

### Option 3: Alternative Libraries
Consider replacing problematic libraries with alternatives:
- **react-native-svg** → Use native Android vector drawables + iOS SF Symbols
- **react-native-screens** → Use React Navigation without native screens optimization

## Current Status

- **Dependencies updated to**: react-native-svg@12.1.1, react-native-screens@3.15.0
- **Build status**: Still failing with same errors
- **Next steps**: Implement one of the recommended solutions above

## Implementation Steps

### For Option 1 (React Native Upgrade):
1. Update React Native to 0.72.0+
2. Run `npx react-native upgrade`
3. Resolve any breaking changes
4. Update dependencies to compatible versions
5. Test thoroughly

### For Option 2 (Legacy Versions):
1. Downgrade to react-native-svg@12.0.0 and react-native-screens@3.10.0
2. Clean install dependencies
3. Test build and functionality

## Conclusion

The Android build failures are caused by fundamental API incompatibilities between React Native 0.80.2 and the required libraries. The most effective solution is to upgrade React Native to a more recent version (0.72.0+) that has better compatibility with current library versions.
